        <strong>Neptune</strong> is cold, dark, and has supersonic winds. It was named Neptune after the Roman god of the sea. Neptune is the only planet in our <em>solar system</em> that can not be seen by the naked eye. Also, the light from the sun here on Earth is <ins>900</ins>times as bright as the light that can be seen if you were on Neptune.

 Newton's thought experiment for getting into orbit is based on a canon being fired from a high mountain. He states that depending on the speed, the projectile will either hit the ground, begin to orbit the Earth or fly out of the Earth's atmosphere. This experiment describes how gravity is the main force that keeps objects in orbit. A spacecraft's periapsis is the point at which it is close to the planet's surface when orbiting. A spacecraft's apoapsis is the point when orbiting that it is furthest from the surface of the planet.
